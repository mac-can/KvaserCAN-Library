# Running CAN and CAN FD on Mac&reg;

_Running CAN and CAN FD on Mac_ is the mission of the MacCAN project.
The MacCAN-Core repo is not aimed at building a driver or a library.
It provides the source code of an abstraction (or rather of a wrapper) of Apple´s IOUsbKit to create USB user-space drivers for CAN interfaces from various vendors under macOS.

## A Stupid Question

I´m working with the CAN bus since the late 1990th, mainly on microcontrollers
(CANopen, SAE J1939, ISO-TP, UDS, etc.), but also on PC. See my [blog](https://www.uv-software.com/wordpress/) for the things I did.

Sometimes I tend to ask myself some stupid questions like _"Is it possible to ...?"_.
In 2010 I asked a well known search engine if it is possible to run CAN on a Mac.
I only found the request of a student, who had to do a semester work with CAN bus.
But that poor boy only owned a Mac.

## MacCAN - macOS Driver for PCAN-USB Interfaces and more

In the absence of a CAN driver for Mac, I started developing an OS X user space driver for my PEAK USB-to-CAN dongle.
Many thanks to Uwe Wilhelm, CEO of PEAK-System Technik GmbH, who had supported me with technical information and several hardware.

### PCBUSB Library for PEAK´s PCAN-USB Interfaces

The _PCBUSB_ library realizes a USB user-space driver under macOS for PCAN&reg; USB interfaces from PEAK-System Technik.
See the [MacCAN](https://www.mac-can.com) website for further information, downloads and links.

The library supports up to 8 PCAN-USB and PCAN-USB FD devices.
It offers an easy to use API that is almost compatible to PEAK´s PCANBasic DLL on Windows.
Standard CAN frames (11-bit identifier) as well as extended CAN frames (29-bit identifier) are supported.
PCAN-USB FD devices can be operated in CAN 2.0 mode and in CAN FD mode.

The library comes with an Objective-C wrapper and a demo App; see https://youtu.be/v0U_WN7s3ao/ \
Furthermore, it can be used with the Qt&reg; Serial Bus API on a Mac; see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtserialbus-index.html

The PCBUSB library is closed source, please note the copyright and license agreements.

### TouCAN USB Interfaces from Rusoku

Rusoku Technologies is an innovative engineering team based in Lithuania, Europe.
They offer CAN adapter at a reasonable price.
Drivers and utilities for Windows and Linux are available as open-source.
See [Rusoku](https://www.rusoku.com)´s website for the products and the services they offer.

The [MacCAN-TouCAN driver](https://mac-can.github.io/drivers/RusokuCAN/) for TouCAN USB interfaces from Rusoku is the first driver implementation based on MacCAN-Core.
And it is open source;
goto https://github.com/mac-can/RusokuCAN.dylib.

### CAN Leaf Interfaces from Kvaser

The Swedish company [Kvaser AB](https://www.kvaser.com) supplies advanced CAN solutions to engineers designing and deploying systems for manifold areas of applications.
They offer a wide range of CAN hardware and CAN software, mainly for applications under Windows but also under Linux.

Welcome the [MacCAN-KvaserCAN driver](https://mac-can.github.io/drivers/KvaserCAN/) for CAN Leaf interfaces from Kvaser as the next member of the MacCAN family.
Find its source code on GitHub;
goto https://github.com/mac-can/MacCAN-KvaserCAN-Library.
